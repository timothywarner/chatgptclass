# Advanced Prompting Strategies Guide

## Core Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought
Break complex problems into smaller, logical steps:

```
Instead of:
"How do I migrate this MongoDB database to PostgreSQL?"

Better:
"Let's approach this MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration in steps:
1. First, what's the current MongoDB schema?
2. What data types need to be mapped?
3. What are the relationships between collections?
4. How should we handle the migration process?
Please help me with step 1 first."
```

### 2. Context Management
Preserve context by being selective and focused:

```
Instead of:
"Here's my entire 1000-line codebase, help me optimize it"

Better:
"I'm optimizing a data processing pipeline. Let's focus on the ETL function first:
[specific function]
What performance bottlenecks do you see in this specific function?"
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
Start broad, then refine with follow-ups:

```
Initial:
"Review this API design"

Refinement 1:
"Focus on the authentication flow in this API design"

Refinement 2:
"Specifically, how can we improve the token refresh mechanism?"
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Breaking Down Complex Problems
Take a complex task and break it into a chain of smaller prompts:

1. Start with: "I need to build a user authentication system"
2. Break into:
   - "What are the core components needed?"
   - "How should we handle password storage?"
   - "What's the JWT token structure?"

### Exercise 2: Context Scoping
Practice limiting scope while maintaining essential context:

1. Start with a large problem
2. Identify the minimal context needed
3. Structure your prompt to focus on one aspect
4. Gradually expand scope as needed

### Exercise 3: Iterative Problem Solving
Practice the art of follow-up prompts:

1. Start broad: "Review this code structure"
2. Focus: "Analyze the error handling pattern"
3. Specific: "How to improve the retry mechanism?"
4. Implementation: "Show me the improved retry code"

## Best Practices

### Clarity
- Be specific about your goals
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Provide relevant context upfront

### Structure
- Use numbered lists for steps
- Break complex requests into bullet points
- Format code blocks properly

### Context Control
- Start small, expand as needed
- Remove irrelevant details
- Keep track of context across multiple prompts

### Iteration
- Start with high-level guidance
- Drill down into specifics
- Use follow-up questions effectively
- Build on previous responses

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Context Overload**
   - Dumping too much information at once
   - Not prioritizing relevant details

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Trying to solve everything in one prompt
   - Not breaking down complex problems

3. **Ambiguous Requests**
   - Vague or unclear objectives
   - Missing critical context

4. **Poor Follow-up**
   - Not building on previous context
   - Repeating information unnecessarily

## Exercise Templates

### Template 1: Problem Breakdown
```
I need to [complex task]. Let's break this down:
1. What are the main components needed?
2. Which component should we focus on first?
3. What are the specific requirements for that component?
Let's start with #1.
```

### Template 2: Context Management
```
Context: I'm working on [specific part] of [larger system]
Current focus: [specific problem]
Relevant details:
- [detail 1]
- [detail 2]
Question: [specific question about current focus]
```

### Template 3: Iterative Development
```
Stage 1: [broad concept]
Current stage: [specific aspect]
Progress so far: [summary]
Next step needed: [specific question]
```

## Practice Scenarios

1. **System Design**
   - Break down a complex system design
   - Focus on one component at a time
   - Iterate through different aspects

2. **Code Review**
   - Start with architecture review
   - Focus on specific modules
   - Drill down into implementation details

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - Describe the overall problem
   - Focus on specific symptoms
   - Investigate potential causes one by one 

## Interactive Workshop

### Workshop 1: Chain-of-Thought Evolution
Start with this complex problem and evolve your prompting approach:

```
Initial Problem:
"Our team needs to migrate our monolithic e-commerce app to microservices."

Your Task:
1. Write your first prompt attempting to solve this
2. Identify what's wrong with your prompt
3. Break it down using chain-of-thought
4. Compare the responses
5. Refine further based on the responses
```

### Workshop 2: Context Management Game
Practice managing context with this exercise:

```
Scenario: You have a bug in a full-stack application
Rules:
1. Start with only 3 sentences about the bug
2. ChatGPT can ask for more information
3. You can only provide information that's asked for
4. Track how the conversation evolves
5. Note when adding context improves or confuses the response

Goal: Resolve the bug with minimal but sufficient context
```

### Workshop 3: Prompt Refinement Challenge
Take this vague prompt and improve it through iterations:

```
Starting Prompt:
"My code is slow. How do I make it faster?"

Your Task:
1. List what's missing from this prompt
2. Add context in stages
3. Test each iteration
4. Document how responses change
5. Find the optimal balance of detail
```

### Workshop 4: Role-Playing Scenarios
Practice different prompting styles based on roles:

```
Scenario 1: You're a Junior Developer
- Start with a basic question
- Learn to ask for explanations
- Practice following up on technical terms

Scenario 2: You're a Tech Lead
- Begin with architectural questions
- Focus on trade-offs
- Guide the conversation toward specific solutions

Scenario 3: You're a Product Manager
- Start with user requirements
- Break down features
- Translate technical responses to business terms
```

### Workshop 5: Real-Time Problem Solving
Pick a real problem you're facing and solve it live:

1. **Initial Documentation**
   - Write down the problem
   - List what you know
   - Note what you don't know

2. **Prompt Strategy**
   - Design your prompting approach
   - Plan your conversation flow
   - Prepare follow-up questions

3. **Execution**
   - Start the conversation
   - Document each response
   - Adjust your approach based on responses

4. **Analysis**
   - Review the conversation
   - Identify effective/ineffective prompts
   - Create a template from successful patterns

### Workshop 6: Prompt Battle
Compare different prompting approaches:

```
Challenge: Optimize a database query
Round 1: Direct Question
- Write a simple prompt
- Note the response

Round 2: Chain of Thought
- Break down the problem
- Compare with Round 1

Round 3: Context-Rich
- Add relevant details
- Compare with previous rounds

Analysis:
- Which approach worked best?
- Why?
- What patterns emerged?
```

### Workshop 7: Context Minimization Challenge
Practice providing just enough context:

```
Exercise:
1. Start with a complex code review request
2. Remove one piece of context at a time
3. Test if the response is still useful
4. Find the minimal viable context
5. Document your findings

Goal: Find the sweet spot between too much and too little context
```

## Workshop Tips
- Document your prompts and responses
- Experiment with different approaches
- Learn from unsuccessful attempts
- Build your own template library
- Share and compare results with others
