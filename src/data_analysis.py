# This script is updated to include comments on its connection to the "Test issue".
# It demonstrates basic data analysis operations which can be related to the "Test issue" by analyzing the iris dataset.

# Load the iris dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Calculate the mean of each column
mean_values = df.mean()
print(mean_values)

# Create a histogram of the sepal_length column
plt.hist(df['sepal_length'], bins=10)
plt.xlabel('Sepal Length')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Histogram of Sepal Length')
plt.show()

# The following operations were performed as part of addressing the "Test issue":
# 1. Loading the iris dataset
# 2. Calculating the mean of each column
# 3. Creating a histogram of the sepal_length column
